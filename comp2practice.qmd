## Vectors in R

```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)

class(marmots)

marmots
#adding class, all elements have to be of the same class. adding quotations makes character
```

## create numeric vector

```{r}
pica <- c(1, 33, 17, 5, 18)

class(pica)
##check class if something isnt working. cna be checke quickly in console

```

```{r}
bear <- c(20L, 3L, 5L, 40L)
```

## Vector Addition and Subtraction

```{r}
ringtail <- c(4.3, 8.9, 2.6, 5)

fox <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

ringtail_fox <- ringtail + fox

ringtail_fox

ringtail_minus_fox <- ringtail - fox

ringtail - fox

ringtail_minus_fox

## scaler multiplier

100 * ringtail

##dot product

ringtail %*% fox
```
